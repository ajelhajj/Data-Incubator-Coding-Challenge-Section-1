# Data-Incubator-Coding-Challenge-Section-1
This repo contains my submission for Section 1 of the May 2019 Data Incubator Coding Challenge. Though Data Incubator does not release the solutions, I was able to pass this round. 
The subject of this coding segment was the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset, which may be downloaded here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95
